# ðŸ¦Ÿ Singapore-Dengue-Analysis #

Singapore's tropical climate provides the perfect breeding ground for Aedes mosquitoes. Consequently, the country is highly prone to dengue outbreaks. The project's objective is to deliver actionable insights through **data visualization**, stressing the importance of personal protection and supporting public health strategies. 

To achieve this, the project employs geospatial, temporal, cluster, and correlation analyses. Utilizing **Tableau** as the primary visualization tool, the project ensures interactive dashboards, while Python with pandas facilitates data cleaning and manipulation.

### Dataset ###
The Singapore Dengue dataset, compiled by Team SGCharts from [data]( https://outbreak.sgcharts.com/data) provided by the National Environmental Agency (NEA), spans a five-year period, running from May 2015 to November 2020. 

### Dashboard Visual Analysis Results and Discussion ###
First, our geographical visualization from July 2015 to November 2020 highlights dengue case density in Singapore, using red for high and green for low occurrences. Regions like Geylang, Bedok, Serangoon, and Woodlands show clustering, aligning with research on urban areas and older buildings facilitating mosquito breeding. Inhabitants in red/orange regions should exercise caution.

Second, the bottom left illustration showcased yearly clusters and total cases, revealing a significant drop in 2017 due to Project Wolbachia. However, the 2019-2020 surge can be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic with increasing mosquito exposure at home.

Third, the bottom right illustrates the Dengue, Temperature, and Rainfall correlation. August, the second hottest month, records the most cases. Contrarily, November and December, cooler with more rainfall, exhibit fewer cases. While temperature and rainfall impact transmission, various factors influence dengue trends. 

The final visualization explores Project Wolbachia's phases in Tampines and Yishun. While Aedes mosquito populations decreased, dengue cases persisted, suggesting a need for reevaluation.
