# Singapore-Dengue-Analysis

Dengue, a globally significant mosquito-borne disease, is the focal point of this project with a specific emphasis on Singapore's susceptibility to outbreaks due to its tropical climate. Comprehensive insights into historical trends, geographical spread, and correlations with climate factors are imperative for the development of effective public health strategies. The project's objective is to deliver actionable insights through data visualization, stressing the importance of personal protection and supporting public health strategies. To achieve this, the project employs geospatial, temporal, cluster, and correlation analyses. Utilizing Tableau as the primary visualization tool, the project ensures interactive dashboards, while Python with pandas facilitates data cleaning and manipulation.
